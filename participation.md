# How to Participate

We are recruiting participants who:

- Use ChatGPT or similar AI tools regularly.
- Are 18 years or older.
- Are comfortable reading and writing in English (and/or the local site language).

## What you will do

1. Complete a short **onboarding survey** (5–10 minutes).
2. Run a **single, fixed prompt** with your own ChatGPT account.
3. Rate the AI’s answers on:
   - how **correct** they are (0–10), and
   - how **surprising** they feel (0–10),
   with additional ratings for comfort in the sensitive-inference section.
4. (Optional) Take part in follow-up tasks on AI memory and brainstorming.

The study is fully remote and can be completed from your own device.

## Privacy

- We collect **only your numeric scores and survey responses**.
- We **do not** collect any of the AI’s replies, your chat history, or personal documents.
- Participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time.

If you are interested in participating at your site, please contact:

- Canada: [guesswhollm@wasplabs.ca](mailto:guesswhollm@wasplabs.ca)  

Additional site contacts will be added as collaborations are confirmed.
