# Guess Who? Understanding LLM Recall, Inference, and Collaborative Cognition

*Guess Who?* is a multi-site research initiative led by **Dr. Sherif Saad** and the  
**Wicked Applied Security Practices (WASP) Lab** at the University of Windsor.

The study investigates what large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can **remember** and **infer** about their users, how those inferences influence perceptions of **accuracy, surprise, and privacy**, and whether human–AI brainstorming fosters **genuine creativity** or merely amplifies users’ existing viewpoints.

Participants engage in carefully designed experiments that test short- and long-term AI memory, evaluate privacy-sensitive profiling, and analyze collaborative reasoning across cultural contexts. The results aim to clarify how LLMs connect information across sessions, how users experience AI “memory,” and how we can design transparent, trustworthy conversational systems.

The project also serves as a mentorship platform for graduate and senior undergraduate students through remote research internships, offering training in research ethics, data analysis, and responsible AI practices.
